# 📘 Sprint2.1: Basic JavaScript exercises

This repository includes the practical JavaScript exercises completed during **Sprint 2.1** at ITACADEMY.

## 📁 Project Structure

The exercises are organized in folders with three-digit names: the first two digits indicate the topic, 
and the third represents the specific exercise number within that topic.

Each folder contains an HTML file and one or more JavaScript (.js) files, depending on the complexity of the exercise. The HTML file is used to display the output, while the JavaScript files contain the logic.

> 💡 Even though the work was initially split across separate branches, **all exercises are now merged into the `main` branch**.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### **1.1 – Arrow Functions**

- Rewrite traditional functions using arrow syntax.
- Create arrow functions with and without parameters.
- Work with `this` inside arrow functions used in class methods.
- Use arrow functions in loops and asynchronous code (`setTimeout`).

### **1.2 – Ternary Operators**

- Understand basic ternary operator syntax.
- Compare values using conditions.
- Nest multiple ternary operations.
- Use ternary logic in functions and loops.

### **1.3 – Callbacks**

- Define and invoke callback functions.
- Use callbacks for performing calculations.
- Apply callbacks in asynchronous flows like delays.
- Work with callbacks in string and array operations.

### **1.4 – Spread & Rest Operators**

- Combine arrays and copy objects using the spread operator.
- Handle flexible arguments in functions using rest parameters.
- Use destructuring together with rest.
- Spread array values into function arguments and merge objects.

### **1.5 – Array Methods for Transformation**

- Practice with `map`, `filter`, `find`, and `reduce`.
- Chain multiple methods to perform logic in a single line.
- Validate conditions with `every` and `some`.

### **1.6 – Looping Through Arrays**

- Use `forEach`, `for-of`, `for-in`, and other loop types.
- Add conditional logic and control flow inside loops.
- Track indexes manually in `for-of` loops when needed.

### **1.7 – Promises and Async/Await**

- Create and manage Promises.
- Handle results with `.then` and errors with `.catch`.
- Work with `async/await` syntax.
- Use `Promise.all` to handle multiple asynchronous tasks simultaneously.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Understand and write **arrow functions** effectively.
- Apply the **ternary operator** in decision-making scenarios.
- Learn how **callback functions** work and how to use them.
- Use **spread** and **rest** operators with arrays and objects.
- Practice working with loops and advanced **array transformation** methods.
- Gain confidence managing **asynchronous code** using Promises and `async/await`.
